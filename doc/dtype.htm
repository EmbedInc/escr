<br><h1>Data Types</h1>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#bool">Bool</a>
  <li><a href="#integer">integer</a>
  <li><a href="#real">real</a>
  <li><a href="#string">string</a>
  <li><a href="#time">time</a>
  </ul>


<p> Each explicit constant, symbolic constant, variable, and function
value has a data type.  These data types are referred to by name, and are
listed below together with their descriptions.  The data type names are
keywords, and are therefore case-insensitive.  The data types are:

<h2 id="bool">BOOL</h2><indent>

  <p>A value of this type is always either <b>TRUE</b> or <b>FALSE</b>.
  <b>TRUE</b> and <b>FALSE</b> are built in keywords, and are
  case-insensitive.

  <p>The default value for this data type is <b>FALSE</b>.

  </p></indent>

<h2 id="integer">INTEGER</h2><indent>

  <p>An integer value.  Its string representation is:</p><indent>

    <p>[<tt>-</tt>][<i>radix</i><tt>#</tt>]<i>number</i></p></indent>

  <p>Where <i>radix</i> is the radix represented in decimal.  <i>Radix</i>
  must be from 2 to 36, with the default being 10 (ten).  <i>Number</i> is
  the integer number in the specified radix.  The letters A-Z or a-z are
  used for digit values from 10-35.  Each digit value must be less than
  the radix.

  <p>For example, each of the following has the value of 143 in
  decimal:</p><indent>

    <p><tt>143

    <br>10#143

    <br>16#8F

    <br>8#217

    <br>2#10001111</tt>

    </p></indent>

  <p>Integer values are written in decimal by the ESCR system unless this
  is overridden by specific formatting.

  <p>The default value for this data type is 0.

  </p></indent>

<h2 id="real">REAL</h2><indent>

  <p>This data type is also sometimes called floating point in descriptive
  text.  The string representation is a consecutive string of decimal
  digits containing exactly one decimal point before, within, or after it.
  This string may be optionally followed by "E" and an exponent value.
  This is all interpreted as you would expect if you've used a computer
  since the late 1950s.

  <p>Floating point values are written with 7 significant digits by ESCR
  unless this is overridden by specific formatting.

  <p>The default value for this data type is 0.0.

  </p></indent>

<h2 id="string">STRING</h2><indent>

  <p>A string constant is a sequence of characters enclosed in a pair of
  quoted string start/end characters.  These start and end characters can
  be set by the application.  The ESCR default is quotes ("...") or
  apostrophies ('...').

  <p>The value is the characters between but not including the quote
  start/end characters  To include the ending quote character literally in
  a string, it must be written twice consecutively.  This only applies to
  the end-quote character used for the specific string.  For example, both
  these string have the same value (assuming default ESCR
  syntax):</p><indent>

    <p><tt>"Don't say ""never""."

    <br>'Don''t say "never".'</tt>

    </p></indent>

  <p>The dictionary collating sequence is used for string comparisons of
  letters and decimal digits.  A string is less than another string if it
  would be listed earlier in a dictionary according to these rules. Upper
  case letters are immediately less than their lower case counterparts.
  The digits 0-9 are less than all letters. If two strings of different
  length are compared that are equal up to the length of the shorter
  string, then the shorter string is less than the longer string.  The
  space character is less than all other printable characters.

  <p>The collating sequence is not defined for characters other than
  space, the digits 0-9, and the upper and lower case letters A-Z. The
  results for the remaining characters will be consistent on any one
  implementation, but are not guaranteed to be consistent accross
  implementations.

  <p>As an example, the following strings are listed in less than to
  greater than order:<tt>

  <p>"aB" "ab" "cd" "cde" "cde f" "cdef" "def22" "defaa"</tt>

  <p>The default value for this data type is the empty string.

  </p></indent>

<h2 id="time">TIME</h2><indent>

  <p>Values of this data type specify an absolute time.  The time is
  stored internally in 60.30 bit fixed point universal coordinated time
  seconds with zero at the start of year 2000.  This data type therefore
  has a resolution of about 931 picoseconds, and a range of about
  &plusmn;15 billion years.

  <p>The text representation of this data type is:</p><indent>

    <p><tt><i>YYYY</i>/<i>MM</i>/<i>DD</i>.<i>hh</i
    >:<i>mm</i>:<i>ss</i>.<i>ssssss</i></tt>

    </p></indent>

  <p>This is the text representation produced by the ESCR system when a
  time value is implicitly converted to text.  Hours are always written in
  24 hour format, so there is no AM/PM indicator.  When converting to a
  TIME data type from the text representation, trailing fields may be
  omitted after the first slash.  Omitted fields will be assumed to have
  the value 0. For example, all the following text time representations
  indicate 2:00pm on Monday 23 October 2006:</p><indent>

    <p><tt>2006/10/23.14

    <br>2006/10/23.14:00

    <br>2006/10/23.14:00:00</tt>

    </p></indent>

  <p>When TIME values are compared, eariler times are considered less than
  later times.

  <p>The default value for this data type is the start of year 2000.

  </p></indent>
