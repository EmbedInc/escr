<!-- *********************************************************************** -->
<br><h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>

<p>The ESCR system is a script processing system intended to build
applications on that need to execute scripts as part of their function.
The script system executes interpreted code organized as lines of text.

<p>The scripting system can operate in one of two high-level
modes:</p><indent>

  <h3>Script Mode</h3><indent>

    <p>The source code is purely code executed by the script system.  The
    code is therefore a program, with the script system being the
    interpreter that executes the program.

    </p></indent>

  <h3>Pre-processor Mode</h3><indent>

    <p>The source code is the input to a pre-processor.  The purpose of
    the script logic is to transform the pre-processed code into
    post-processed code.  Special syntax is required to identify script
    commands and other constructs.  When no such special syntax is
    present, the data is simply copied from the input file to the output
    file.

    <p>The special syntaxes for identifying script elements are
    configurable by the application using the script system.  For example,
    a particular pre-processor program may use the rule that script
    commands must start with a slash to distinguish them from text that is
    simply data to be copied from the input file to the output file.

    </p></indent>

  </indent>

<p>At its core, the ESCR system is a linkable library.  This library
performs the mechanics of executing script elements, and in pre-processor
mode of identifying script elements and copying other data to the output.
The application provides the lines of source code to process, by
referencing files, file snippets, previously stored source lines, or
source lines generated by the application.

<h2>Customizations</h2><indent>

  <p>Applications can customize certain aspects of the script system that
  affect the scripting "language" as seen by users.  Applications may be
  documented listing only these customizations, then referring to this
  ESCR script system documentation for the remaining language features.

  <p>Each application should specify how it customizes the script system.
  The possible customzations are:</p><ol>

    <li>Whether the script system is run in script mode or pre-processor
    mode.

    <li>Syntax for identifying script comments.  No script interpretation
    is performed within script comments.  In pre-processor mode, script
    comments are not copied to the output file.

    <li>In preprocessor mode, syntax for identifying comments in the data
    file. No script interpretation is performed within data file comments,
    and they are copied to the output file.

    <li>Syntax for identifying script commands.  This is generally not
    used in script mode since all source code is a sequence of script
    commands.

    <li>Additional commands.  The syntax for identifying commands is the
    same for all commands, regardless of whether they are native to the
    script system or added by the application.

    <li>The syntax for identifying functions in-line with other code (or
    also in-line with raw data in pre-processor mode).

    <li>Additional functions.  The syntax for identifying functions is the
    same for all functions, regardless of whether they are native to the
    script system or added by the application.

    <li>Required file name suffixes for include files referenced by the
    native INCLUDE command.

    </ol>

  </indent>

<h2>The ESCR Program</h2><indent>

  <p>The ESCR program uses the script system in script mode.  It is a
  stand-alone interpreter exporting the native features of the ESCR script
  system.  Its purpose is to be a script interpreter, and to serve as a
  example of a minimum application using the ESCR script system.

  <p>Most of this ESCR documentation is written as a manual for the ESCR
  program.  However, all the script execution symantics, such as the
  operation of commands, inline functions, and the like, are implemented
  in the callable ESCR system and therefore apply to other applications
  using this system.

  <p>The script system customizations used by the ESCR program, according
  to the list above, are:</p><ol>

    <li>Script mode, not pre-processor mode.

    <li>Script comments start with "//".  "//" not within a quoted string
    and all characters following the "//" on a line are a comment.
    Comments end at the end of line.

    <li>There are no data file comments.  There is no data since the
    system is not in pre-processor mode.

    <li>There is no special syntax for identifying script commands. The
    first keyword on each line is a script command name.

    <li>No commands are added to those built into the script system.

    <li>Inline functions start with "[" and end with "]".

    <li>No functions are added to those built into the script system.

    <li>The names of files referenced by the INCLUDE command must end in
    ".escr" or ".es".

    </ol>

  </indent>


<!-- *********************************************************************** -->
<br><h1 id="conventions">Documentation Conventions</h1>

<h2>Source code</h2><indent>

  <p>Verbatim source code is shown in

  <p><tt>fixed-space font</tt>

  <p>just like you would see it in a source code editor.&nbsp;

  </p></indent>

<h2>Keywords</h2><indent>

  <p>ESCR keywords are shown in

  <p><b>bold face</b><br>

  <p>in descriptive text.  When they appear within larger source code,
  they are shown in

  <p><tt><b>bold and fixed space</b></tt>

  <p>Keywords are case-insensitive.  They may be shown upper case, lower
  case, or mixed case in this document.

  </p></indent>

<h2>Description</h2><indent>

  <p>Brief descriptions of what to write instead of the actual text to
  write are shown in

  <p><i>italic type</i>

  <p>Such descriptions must be replaced by the item they describe in the
  actual source code.&nbsp;

  </p></indent>


<!-- *********************************************************************** -->
<br><h1 id="versions">Version History</h1>

<h4>18 Oct 2016</h4><indent>

  <p>Main INDEX.HTM created, only sparsely filled in.  Includes Index,
  Introduction, and Version History sections.  Index is very small,
  Introduction is mostly written, and Version History not written at
  all.  Much left to add.

  </p></indent>

<h4>22 Oct 2016</h4><indent>

  <p>Added Version History so far (not much).  Created DTYPE.HTM,
  CMDS.HTM, and FUNC.HTM files with appropriate linking between them.
  Copied the associated sections from the PREPIC documentation file
  into these files.  Fixed up DTYPE.HTM, and got partway thru
  CMDS.HTM.

  </p></indent>

<h4>3 Mar 2017</h4><indent>

  <p>Some minor rewording, typo fixes, etc.  Added default value to the
  description of each data type.  Added <i>Documentation Conventions</i>
  section.  Updated existing documentation to the stated conventions.

  </p></indent>

<h4>13 Mar 2017</h4><indent>

  <p>Finished up command descriptions, added function descriptions.

  </p></indent>

<h4>14 Mar 2017</h4><indent>

  <p>Some fixes and the like.  <a href="func.htm#char">CHAR</a> function
  now takes multiple arguments. <a href="func.htm#pi">PI</a> function now
  takes second optional argument.

  </p></indent>

<h4>16 Mar 2017</h4><indent>

  <p>The <a href="cmds.htm#loop">LOOP</a> command is now more flexible.
  What were previously options that had to be specified in a particular
  sequence are now arbitrary options that can be specified in any
  sequence.  Merged all counted loop types into one.  LOOP N is no longer
  a special case, for example.

  <p>Change FOR keyword to WITH, to more accurately reflect what it does,
  despite convention of existing computing history.

  <p>The loop value is now available in a constant instead of a variable.

  </p></indent>

<h4>2 Apr 2017</h4><indent>

  <p>Added <a href="sym.htm#syntax">qualified symbols syntax</a>.

  <p>Added VER, NAME, and QUAL options to <a href="func.htm#sym">SYM</a>
  function.  A <a href="cmds.htm#loop-symbols">SYMBOLS loop</a> now loops
  over fully qualified symbol names. It previously looped over bare symbol
  names.  A SYMBOLS loop can now take keywords that explicitly list the
  type of symbols to loop over. Previously, all symbols were looped over.

  </p></indent>

<h4>24 Apr 2017</h4><indent>

  <p>Added <a href="sym.htm"><i>Symbols</i></a> section between <i>Data
  types</i> and <i>Commands</i>.

  </p></indent>

<h4>13 Jun 2017</h4><indent>

  <p>Changed ESCR program command line argument handling.

  <p>All command line arguments to the ESCR program beyond the script name
  now become the arguments to the top level execution block.  Previously,
  there were arguments for creating constants of specific values before
  the script was run.

  </p></indent>

<h4>14 Jun 2017</h4><indent>

  <p>Added pre/post increment/decrement functions.

  </p></indent>

  href="cmds.htm#writepush">WRITEPUSH</a> and <a
  href="cmds.htm#writepop">WRITEPOP</a>.

  </p></indent>

<h4>29 Jun 2017</h4><indent>

  <p>Changed the <a href="cmds.htm#loop">LOOP</a> command default
  increment value for counted loops to always be 1.  Was previously 1 or
  -1 depending on the the <b>from</b> and <b>to</b> values.

  </p></indent>

<h4>1 Oct 2017</h4><indent>

  <p>Added optional exit status code argument to the <a
  href="cmds.htm#stop">STOP</a> command.
