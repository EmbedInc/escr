<p>Various objects in the ESCR scripting system are given names.  These
names are referred to as "symbols".  Despite the different objects that
can be referred to by symbols, there are some common syntax rules and
handling of symbols.  Symbols refer to objects like variables and
subroutines.

<h2 id="types">Symbol types</h2><indent>

  <p>There are different types of symbols (not to be confused with data
  types), with most types having their own namespaces.  Each symbol type
  has a name.  These symbol type name keywords are used consistantly in
  the ESCR system to specify symbol types.  Each symbol type has its own
  namespace, except as noted in the descriptions below.  The symbol type
  names are keywords, and are therefore case-insensitive.

  <p>The symbol type names and their meanings are:

  <p id="type-var"><tt><b>VAR</b></tt></p><indent>

    <p>Variables.  These are in the same namespace as constants.

    <p>Variables have a data type and a value.  The value can be changed.

    </p></indent>

  <p id="type-const"><tt><b>CONST</b></tt></p><indent>

    <p>Constants.  These are in the same namespace as variables.

    <p>Constants have a data type and a value.  The value can not be
    changed.

    </p></indent>

  <p id="type-vcon"><tt><b>VCON</b></tt></p><indent>

    <p>Variable or constant.  This symbol type name is only used to
    indicate that a variable or constant is allowed or requested. Actual
    symbols are always variables or constants.  There is no VCON symbol
    type.

    </p></indent>

  <p id="type-subr"><tt><b>SUBR</b></tt></p><indent>

    <p>Subroutines.  These are invoked with the <tt>CALL</tt> command.

    </p></indent>

  <p id="type-macro"><tt><b>MACRO</b></tt></p><indent>

    <p>Macros.  These function like subroutines, but are invoked
    implicitly from data lines (not ESCR command lines) in pre-processor
    mode.  Macros serve no purpose in script mode since there is no
    mechanism to invoke them.

    <p>The details of how a macro invocation is detected in data lines and
    the syntax for passing arguments depend on the application.  The
    default is that the macro name is the first token on a line that does
    not start in column 1.  The first argument is separated from the macro
    name by a space, with subsequent arguments separated by commas.  There
    may be any number of spaces immediately before or after the commas.

    </p></indent>

  <p id="type-func"><tt><b>FUNC</b></tt></p><indent>

    <p>Functions.  A special syntax is used to identify a function and its
    arguments.  The entire function reference is replaced with the
    function output.  Functions are recognized and expanded on ESCR
    command lines and in pre-processor data lines.

    <p>The syntax for recognizing the start and end of functions depend on
    the application.  The default is that functions are enclosed in
    brackets [].

    </p></indent>

  <p id="type-cmd"><tt><b>CMD</b></tt></p><indent>

    <p>Commands.  All lines except blank lines, comment lines, or data
    lines in pre-processor mode start with a command name as the first
    token.  Commands function like subroutines.

    </p></indent>

  <p id="type-label"><tt><b>LABEL</b></tt></p><indent>

    <p>Labels.  Labels are used to refer to specific locations in source
    code.

    </p></indent>

  <p id="type-unsp"><tt><b>UNSP</b></tt></p><indent>

    <p>Unspecified.  Like VCON, this is not actually a symbol type.  It
    can be used in some instances to specify that a symbol type is
    unknown, or that any type of symbol is allowed.

    </p></indent>

  </p></indent>

<h2 id="versions">Versions</h2><indent>

  <p>It is permissible to create a new symbol of the same name as a
  existing symbol.  If the new symbol is of a different fundamental type
  (variable as opposed to a subroutine, for example), then there is no
  conflict since there is a separate name space for each fundamental type.
  If the new symbol is the same type as a previous one, then a new version
  of that symbol is created.

  <p>Symbol versions are numbered starting with 1, with sequentially
  increasing numbers for newer versions.

  <p><h3 id="ver-curr">Current version</h3><indent>

    <p>One version of each symbol, usually the latest, is the "current"
    version.  This version is implicitly referenced when no version
    information is specified in a symbol reference.

    <p>A specific version of a symbol can be referenced either absolutely,
    or relative to the current version.  For example, it is possible to
    explicitly reference the fixed version 1 of a subroutine, or one
    version older than the current version.

    <p>The current version is sometimes not the latest.  When a subroutine
    is called, for example, the current version of that subroutine symbol
    becomes the next older version of the subroutine. Therefore, when no
    version is specified in a subroutine call, the default is calling a
    chain of subroutines, not recursion.  Note that recursion is possible,
    and requires explicitly calling the version of the subroutine +1 from
    the current version.

    </p></indent>

  <p>The versions of a symbol can be thought of as a stack.  The top of
  the stack is the newest version.  New versions are created and pushed
  onto the stack.  When the current version is deleted, it is popped off
  the stack and the next previous version becomes current (if the deleted
  version was current previously).

  <p>The difference from a normal stack is that the current is not
  constrained to always be the top of the stack.  This is the case for
  symbols that represent routines, like subroutines, macros, and commands.

  <p>When other than the last version of a symbol is deleted, the newer
  versions are re-numbered.  The versions of a symbol are always numbered
  sequentially from 1 to the last version without any gaps.

  <p>In the ESCR system, this stacking is the mechanism used in place of
  having local, global, or other, symbol scope.  For example, a subroutine
  creates the variable <tt>ii</tt>, and deletes it upon exit (there is a
  mechanism to make this somewhat automatic).  Inside the subroutine, an
  unqualified reference to just <tt>ii</tt> refers to the variable created
  upon entry to the subroutine.  No harm is done, and there is no
  ambiguity, if a variable <tt>ii</tt> also existed in the calling
  routine.

  <p>The effect is largely the same as achieved by namespace scoping, but
  that versions in other scopes can be accessed <i>when explicitly
  specified</i>.  The syntax to explicitly specify a version other than
  the current is deliberately not something likely to occur by accident,
  and is visually obvious.

  </p></indent>

<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2><indent>

  <p>Symbols are specified with the syntax:</p><indent>

    <p><tt><i>name[</i>:<i>type][</i>:<i>version]</i></tt>

    </p></indent>

  <p><i>Name</i> is the bare symbol name.  It must be from 1 to 80
  characters.  At most, the printable ASCII characters except ":" (colon)
  are allowed.  Specifically, this means character codes from 33 to 127
  except for 58 (colon).  There are further restrictions dependent on the
  application.  For example, when functions are delimited with <tt>[</tt>
  and <tt>]</tt>, then these characters are also not allowed to be used in
  symbol names.

  <p><i>Type</i> explicity specifies the type of symbol.  If present, this
  must be one of the symbol type name keywords shown above.  The default
  for <i>type</i> allows for any symbol type within the context the symbol
  reference is used in.  It is an error to specify a symbol type
  incompatible with the context.

  <p>For example, the <tt>CALL</tt> command requires a subroutine name
  symbol as its first argument.  Therefore,</p><indent>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>CALL abcd:subr</tt></p></indent>

  <p>could be valid, but</p><indent>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>CALL abcd:var</tt></p></indent>

  <p>is definitely not valid.

  <p>When referring to an existing symbol, and all symbol types are valid,
  then the symbol types have precedence in the order VAR and CONST, SUBR,
  MACRO, FUNC, CMD, and LABEL.  For example, if both a constant
  <tt>ABC</tt> and a subroutine <tt>ABC</tt> exist and the context does
  not limit the symbol type, just the symbol reference <tt>ABC</tt> will
  refer to the constant.  However, <tt>CALL ABC</tt> will call subroutine
  <tt>ABC</tt> since the symbol type of SUBR is implied from context.

  <p><i>Version</i> specifies the version of the symbol.  <i>Version</i>
  must be a integer value, which may be preceeded by "+" or "-".

  <p>Without a preceeding "+" or "-", <i>version</i> specifies the
  absolute version of the symbol.  Versions start at 1 and increase by 1
  sequentially for each newer version.  It is an error to specify a fixed
  version &lt; 1.

  <p>When <i>version</i> starts with "+" or "-", then the integer value is
  relative to the current version.  Positive values indicate newer
  versions and negative older.  <i>Version</i> of <tt>+0</tt> or
  <tt>-0</tt> specifies the current version.

  <p>When <i>version</i> is not specified, the current version of the
  symbol is referenced.

  <p>For a symbol reference to indicate an existing symbol, the symbol of
  that name, of that type, and of that version must exist.  If any of
  these is not true, then a non-existing symbol is referenced.  That may
  cause an error, depending on context.

  </p></indent>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2><indent>

  <p><tt>abcd</tt></p><indent>

    <p>The current version of symbol <tt>abcd</tt>.  If multiple symbol
    types are allowed from context, then this refers to the variable or
    constant <tt>abcd</tt> if that exist, else the subroutine
    <tt>abcd</tt>, else the macro <tt>abcd</tt>, etc.

    </p></indent>

  <p><tt>abcd:subr</tt></p><indent>

    <p>The current version of subroutine <tt>abcd</tt>.

    </p></indent>

  <p><tt>abcd:2</tt></p><indent>

    <p>Version 2 of <tt>abcd</tt>.  This is a reference to a non-existent
    symbol even if <tt>abcd</tt> exists but has no version 2.

    </p></indent>

  <p><tt>abcd:subr:+0</tt></p><indent>

    <p>The current version of subroutine <tt>abcd</tt>.

    </p></indent>

  <p><tt>abcd:subr:-1</tt></p><indent>

    <p>The next older version of subroutine <tt>abcd</tt>.

    </p></indent>

  <p><tt>abcd:subr:+1</tt></p><indent>

    <p>The next newer version of subroutine <tt>abcd</tt>.  Inside a
    subroutine, the current version is the next older version of that
    subroutine.  Calling the "+1" version of the subroutine currently in
    is calling itself recursively.

    </p></indent>

  <p><tt>abcd:+1</tt></p><indent>

    <p>The next newer version of <tt>abcd</tt>.

    <p>If this is the first argument of a <tt>CALL</tt> command, then it
    is the same as the previous example, since the SUBR symbol type is
    implied from context.

    </p></indent>

  </p></indent>
