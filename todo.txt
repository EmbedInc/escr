Add LIST data type.

Add a command to execute matching choice(s).  Like Pascal CASE, C SWITCH,
etc.

Add LOOP LIST.  Loops over explicit list of tokens in a string.

Find a way to have Windows automatically run .escr files.  Need procedural
interface equivalent to the ASSOC and FTYPE commands, and the PATHEXT
environment variable.  The IQueryAssociations function seems to be
relevant.
